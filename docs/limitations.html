<h1>Limitations</h1>

<p>SheShe provides tools for modal analysis, but several limitations apply:</p>

<h2>Dependence on surface representation</h2>
<p>The algorithms assume a smooth and well-sampled surface. Imperfect meshes or sparse points degrade boundary estimates.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> preprocess meshes to remove noise, interpolate missing regions and validate against known benchmarks.</p>

<h2>High-dimensional approximations</h2>
<p>In very high dimensions SheShe relies on approximations that may miss subtle structures and increase computation time.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> apply dimensionality reduction or focus on informative subspaces with <a href="./subspacescout.html">SubspaceScout</a>.</p>

<h2>Noise and sampling sensitivity</h2>
<p>Noisy or sparsely sampled data can produce unstable boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> denoise inputs and aggregate multiple runs through <a href="./modalscoutensemble.html">ModalScoutEnsemble</a>.</p>

<h2>Parameter tuning</h2>
<p>Performance depends on choosing suitable bandwidths and clustering thresholds.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> explore settings via the <a href="./quick_api.html">Quick API</a> and cross-validation.</p>
